		<span class="j">J</span>ICO F.M first hit the air on the 21st of November 2015, by then it was just a small room with basic radio equipment.The radio station solely exists to develop significant radio signals that will enhance development and social mobilization in Jinja College. This radio station was established to reduce social cohesion arising from the different factions of the college. These factions were responsible for about 90% of the student riots, but ever since this establishment, the number of riots on the premises has significantly dropped by 65%. What this radio has done, is give the people of jinja college a voice, a platform for society to air their grieveinces in an orderly fashion, a fashion that doesn't disrupt the normal operation of the communities.
